Could you help me?\n\n-------- Text follows: --------\n\nThe GuiPlayerView control is SO awesome. It displays the players quite well... but... I have made a script that is of much use to many modellers and skinners. If utilizes the GuiPlayerView control to actually display any DTS object in the game.\n\nIt seems to work very well, with a few minor exceptions:\n\n* Very large models do not render well. There is a lot of flicker. Can that be eliminated?\n\n* Zoom doesn\'t seem proportional to the size of the viewed object. It seems to have a fixed minimum and maximum size. Can it be made either proportional or just larger, so that people can zoom in closer and zoom out farther? (to more easily see smaller and larger models)\n\n* A few models don\'t render at all (I was wondering why) like: heavy_male_dead for example.\n\n* I can understand the logic behind attaching weapons to certain \"registration points\" on models, this way each player can be shown holding a weapon. Would it be possible to disable this \"spinfusorama\" on all non-player models? It makes the grav cycle look kinda funny :P\n\nI know that this control was only intended for displaying players in the GameGui, hence its name \"GuiPlayerView\" .. but with a few minor tweaks, skinners and modellers will have a SUPER useful tool at their disposal!\n\nThanks for listening, DEV team guys. Keep up the good work!\n\nBTW, if you want to check out the script I have created, it\'s available here: <a:www.tribalwar.com/cowboy/cb.cgi?page=dts>http://www.tribalwar.com/cowboy/cb.cgi?page=dts</a> and is about 2k in size (nice and easy)\n\\\n- Cowboy\n\n
